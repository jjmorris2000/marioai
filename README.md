A few notes here..

To run multiple scenarios involving learning, check out ch.idsia.scenarios.oldscenarios.Evolve.java - this file contains a loop that does learning (GA learning maybe?) and has the core for how to progress forward I think with testing a learning agent.  Saving the file is borked, so this needs to be fixed (possibly related to me "fixing" the characters in one of the files to get everything to compile - check this out later).
